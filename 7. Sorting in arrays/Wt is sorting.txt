what are sorting algorithms is data structures & we will also understand why we need sorting algorithms?

What is a Sorting Algorithm ?
A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list DS elements according to a particular pattern(For e.g. Ascending or Descending order). The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure.

Why do we need sorting algorithms ?
Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) which require input data to be in sorted lists.
Producing more human readable output.
It is easier and faster to locate items in a sorted list than unsorted.

Types of Sorting Algorithms ?
Selection Sort
Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Heap Sort
Radix Sort
etc etc...
